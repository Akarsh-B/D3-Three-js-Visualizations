                <p>
                    The graph above shows the percentage change in consumer spending by category for the
                    week of March 26 through April 1, 2020 over the same week in 2019. The graph is based on data on
                    credit
                    and
                    debit cards purchases of nearly six million people in the United States, as tracked and analyzed by
                    Earnest Research.

                    The graph shows very well how things changed during the 2020 quarantine, As seen from the graph
                    during the "Stay at Home", there was huge boom in the sale of Gaming Accessories and Alcohol and
                    people started ordering groceries online. Because of the Fast food centres being closed, lot of
                    them moved towards online food delivery. <br> <br />
                    The Airlines, Movies and Cruises got hit because of the Social Distancing measures. The sales of
                    products like Mobiles and general merchandise remained the same.
                </p>

                    This visualization clealy explains how there the trend of spending changed due to quarantine and
                    by how much percentage it changed over the year. The size of the data visualized is also a great
                    measure to understand industry's sales duing the period. Overall the aesthetics looks good. The
                    color codes used are visually appealing and its a great way to visualize the data of the topic of
                    interest.
